# creocleaner
A simple utility to quickly delete old creo versioned files

[Download compiled runnable jar](https://github.com/r-downing/creocleaner/releases/download/1.0.0/creocleaner.jar)

When saving files in Creo Parametric (formerly Pro-E), it saves every modification as a new file with a number extension at the end (mymodel.part.1, ...2 ...3). There is an option in the program to remove old versions, but for an assembly with many drawings and models, this lets you clean it up all at once. Only the newest version of each file will remain.


# Usage

Requires [JRE](https://java.com/en/download/)

Run the jar file and select the folder to be cleaned. Or place it inside the desired folder and just press Open.

It's a tiny file (<2kb) so I leave a copy in all my creo project folders.
